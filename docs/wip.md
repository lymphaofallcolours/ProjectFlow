## Current Session

**Date:** 2026-03-03
**Goal:** Fix subnode crash, long-press behavior, context menu UX

### Completed This Session

- **Previous batch:** dot visibility, subnode dismiss/opacity, help panel (4 fixes)
- **Fix 5: Subnode crash (white screen)** — eliminated stale `radialNodeId` closures in `onSelectionChange` and `onNodeClick` (now read fresh via `useUIStore.getState()`); added `radialNodeExists` render guard; added `radialNodeId` cleanup to `deleteNode`, `deleteSelectedNodes`, and `deleteGroup` in graph-store
- **Fix 6: Long-press on unselected nodes** — `handleLongPress` in story-node now calls `selectNodes([id])` before `showRadialSubnodes`, so a single long-press selects AND shows subnodes
- **Fix 7: Context menu Escape dismiss** — added `useEscapeKey(onClose)` to `NodeContextMenu` and `EdgeContextMenu` (canvas already had it, refactored to use shared hook)
- **Fix 8: Context menu viewport overflow** — new `useMenuPosition` hook uses `useLayoutEffect` to measure menu dimensions and reposition upward/leftward when overflowing viewport bounds; applied to all 3 context menus
- **Fix 9: Right-pointing combat triangle** — rotated triangle from upward to right-pointing (`M 4,4 L 140,62 L 4,120 Z`), wide left edge gives more text room; handle insets for all 4 directions; label padding shifted left toward centroid
- **Fix 10: Playthrough notes visibility** — status dot tooltip now includes `playthroughNotes`; added `CockpitPlaythroughPanel` to cockpit overlay showing status + notes when set
- **Fix 11: Light mode contrast** — adjusted 6 CSS variables (glass opacity, border tint, canvas, text-muted, node fill); replaced 5 hardcoded `hover:bg-white/*` classes in cockpit with `hover:bg-surface-glass`
- **Fix 12: Subnode drag dismiss** — subnodes now dismiss when the user starts dragging their target node (checked in `onNodesChange` drag-start transition)
- **Fix 13: Subnode spacing & contrast** — orbit radius 72→110, subnode size 40→36, border 1.5→2px, empty border uses `--color-border` instead of glass-border, stronger drop shadows
- **Fix 14: Subnode scroll/zoom dismiss** — added `onMoveStart` handler to ReactFlow that dismisses subnodes on any pan/zoom (scroll, pinch, drag-pan)
- **Fix 15: Playthrough requires active session** — disabled playthrough status options in context menu when no session is active; shows "Start a session to track playthrough" hint instead. Prevents desync between node status and session log.

### Test Coverage

- ~706 unit/integration tests across 46 test files
- 25 E2E tests (Chromium + Firefox) across 6 test suites
- Domain: ~232 + 3 node shapes = ~235
- Application: ~193 + 2 UI store = ~195
- Infrastructure: 13 (serialization)
- UI: 66 (unchanged)
- Integration: ~104 (unchanged)
- E2E: 25 (node-selection 3, canvas-interaction 3, campaign-name 2, subnode-trigger 3, node-drag 1, cockpit-modes 1 × 2 browsers)

### Blocked / Needs Attention

- Firefox Playwright Ctrl+Click test skipped — React Flow pane intercepts pointer events in Firefox's Playwright driver; works fine in manual testing

### Next Steps (Phase 10)

1. **Inline TipTap image nodes** — content format migration from plain text to JSON/ProseMirror schema
2. **Nested groups** — groups containing groups (multi-level hierarchy, recursive collapse)
3. **External file references** — avoid base64 bloat for very large assets
4. **Bulk entity import/export** — CSV or markdown
5. **Advanced tag features** — tag auto-suggest, tag hierarchies, tag-based graph coloring

### TODOs in Code

- (none — no TODOs or FIXMEs in codebase)
